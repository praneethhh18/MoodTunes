## How to Use Social Sharing

### Sharing Your Mood

### Sharing Your Playlist
1. After mood detection, scroll down to the playlist section
2. Use the share buttons below the playlist:
   - Share buttons include playlist information in the message
   - Shared links contain both mood and playlist data

### Viewing Shared Content
- When someone shares a MoodTunes link with you, clicking it will:
  - Display a green banner indicating shared content
  - Show the friend's detected mood
  - Display their recommended playlist
  - Allow you to share or detect your own mood
